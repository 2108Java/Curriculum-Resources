<!-- 
	We are going to need a few tools: 
			Beans 
			Context 
			
	Our Inversion of controller will control "beans". 
		Beans are our layers/dependencies that we have in our project. 
		
	What is a Spring bean?
		A spring bean is an object that you've told Spring to manage for you. (NOTHING TO DO WITH JAVA BEAN)

 <bean name = "PlanetDaoFirst" class = "com.revature.repo.PlanetDaoImpl" scope = "prototype"></bean>
 <bean name = "PlanetDaoSecond" class = "com.revature.repo.PlanetDaoImpl"></bean>
 

 
 <!-- Scopes of a Sprring bean!
 		Singleton (default) tells Spring to ONLY create a SINGLE instance 
 		Prototype tells Spring ot make as many instances as required - create a new instance when someone asks for it!
