Maven is a built automation tool that we levarage to manage our applications. 

(There are many of them, Gradle, ant, etc. )

Maven allows us to automate the process of building our projects into an 
	distributal format that can be deployed into a server. 

Maven lifecycle: 

	check if the code is valid 
	
	compile 

	testing 

mvn install : validate -> compile -> test -> package -> verify -> install 

mvn clean install: this is the same, but I clear out any previous jar files I've made 

"clean" is not a mvn goal, it's a modifer that cleans up our packages.
