Normalization is the process of reducing data redundancy in our 
database. 

What is data redundancy?
	Keeping track of unnecessary data because our tables 
	are not structured appropriately. 

Industry standard for normalisation is 3rd Normal Form 
There are 6 NF, but we will only look up to 3rd Normal Form. 

"The Key"
1 Normal Form. 
	Primary key : unique identifier for row/records 
	Atomic Columns (smallest indivisible amount of data)

"The Whole Key" 
2nd Normal Form: 
	We need to achieve at least 1st NF
	We need to have no partial dependencies on the primary key. 

"Nothing But The Key" 
3rd Normal Form: 
	We need to achieve at least 2nd Normal Form 
	We can't have transitive dependencies. 

	If I have numbers, a , b and c. 
	if a is greater than b : a > b 
	and if b is greater than c: b > c 
	then that implies a is greater than c ==> a > c
	(without having directly compared them)  

"Keys":
	Primary key : unique identifier for row/record
	Foreign Key : primary key of another table, that our table references. 
	Candidate Key : is a column that can "act" as a primary key (BUT IS NOT)
	Composite key : is multiple columns that can act as a primary key
			(when combined together)
