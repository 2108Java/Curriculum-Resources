Angular 

AngularJS vs Angular 4+ 

Angular is a Typescript-based open-source framework used to develop dynamic single page
	applications. (Created by Google) Angular runs on Node.js environment. 


Single page application?
	A single page that does all the work, all the view the user needs. 

	A SPA is a web application that fits on a single page in the browser. 
	All of our JS, HTML and CSS code is retrieved ONCE, onto a single web page. 

	The benefits: 
		Fast and responsive: 
			Once our page is loaded up, all the resoureces are there for the client.

		Caching: 
			Because we only need to load up the resources once, all the informatino 
			can be cached and stored on the client side. (No need for repeat connections)


	Disadvantages:
		Front loaded: 
			Because we're loading up everything, the first load is slow. 

		Poor SEO performance: 
			Search Engine Optimization. 

		Cross-site scripting attacks: 
			SPAs are less secure against those. 


Typescript: 

	Typescript is a super set of javascript. Everything js can do, ts can do more. 

	Typsescript was made by Microsoft and maintained by them. 

	TS main purpose is to introduce back OOP as well as Strongly typed syntax and 
	type safety checking. 


Node: 
	node.js is an open-source, cross-platform *runtime environment* built on Chrome's 
	B8 Javascript engine. 

	It allows us to execute JS code outside of a web browser and provides us a library 
	of various JS modules. 

	We use Node.js and npm as tools for building Angular. 

npm: 
	node package managers, allows us to install everything related to node.
