Angular Folder Structure 

	node_modulus: library/dependencies that our angular project is going to use!

	package.json: is the confiugration for our Angular projecter. It's a json file, 
			smimilar to our pom.xml file in Maven. 

	src: 
		Is mainly where we are going to be working in. 
		It contiains the "single" html file that will be our view. 

	webpack: 
		Used to bundle together our Javascript modules (i.e. files) into a single
		Javascript file(s). 


Angular key terms: 
	
	Component: 
		Component is responsible for a portion of a view of the page
		Can be created in CLI, using ng generate comopnent <name>
		Components come by default with: .html, .css, .ts, .spec.ts 
		A componet is declared in the ngModule, that it can be used by Angular. 
		@Component is what makes a .ts class into a component 
			(templateUrl, StyleUrls, selector)

	Data binding: 
		one-way binding (using interpolation) {{}}
		property-binding []
		event-binding () 
		2-way binding: 
			by default, we don't get to use it. 
			We have to actually import it from the dependencies we have. 

	Directives: 
		Manipulate our html view 
		Structrual Directives: Add or remove elements from the DOM
			*ngIf
			*ngFor 

		Attribute Directives: modify the attributes of existing elements!
			There are inbuilt ones, that I'll let you find out. 
			I'm going to make my own!


Sending information back and forth in a parent child component relationship 

	Sending info from child 

	click event -> child function to trigger -> child function triggers an event of it's own
	-> parent comopnent triggers its function based on the child's event!
